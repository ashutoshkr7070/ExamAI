# ExamAI

This project is to identify cheating during proctored online examination. This code is capable of plotting the cheating percentage with real time. 
It obseves and detect various features of the user giving exam like:


    1. Head movement like sidewards, upwards, and downward
    2. detection of mobile phone and books
    3. No person in the frame
    4. More than one person in the frame
    5. Person speaking or talking to someone else
    6  other things like constant disturbance in camera

We utilized the pre-trained dataset which we downloaded from the given link:


      https://github.com/italojs/facial-landmarks-recognition/blob/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat


Given below is the testimonial video of how does this ML model works in real time. The best thing is that we can implement it in small devices too , like mobile phone or raspberry-pi. However, for now, we have used the VS code environment to run the program.
